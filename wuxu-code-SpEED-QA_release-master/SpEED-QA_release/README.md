=================================================================

The current release implements SpEED-QA, an efficient image and video quality reduced-reference predictor in the spatial domain. SpEED-QA is based on local operations in the spatial domain and entropic differencing. It calculates the conditional entropies of mean-subtracted coefficients and applies entropic differencing between the reference and distorted image or video. For videos the aforementioned process is repeated on the frame differences as well yielding a temporal quality scores. This score is then combined with the spatial (still picture) quality indicator yielding the video version of SpEED: SpEED-VQA.
The attached code also implements multi-scale SpEED for Image Quality Assessment (IQA), where the still picture SpEED is applied on 5 scales, then combined into a single score using MS-SSIM weights.
The current release contains demo images for testing. For videos, you need to include a reference and a distorted video and call them from the code.

Further details:

SpEED for Image Quality Assessment (IQA):

blk_speed: size of the wavelet block used in the GSM model, set to 3x3 for images

Nscales: number of scales to decompose the image. This parameter is related to the multi-scale version of SpEED.

sigma_nsq: neural noise term, set to 0.1 (default value)

down_size_ss: number of times to downscale the original image. For IQA, SpEED-IQA performs best for down_size_ss = 2

window: Gaussian window, same as in BRISQUE

SpEED for Image Quality Assessment (VQA):

blk_speed: size of the wavelet block used in the GSM model, set to 5x5 for videos

sigma_nsq: neural noise term, set to 0.1 (default value)

down_size: number of times to downscale the original image and the frame difference. For VQA, SpEED-VQA performs best for down_size = 4

window: Gaussian window, same as in BRISQUE

For videos, you need to supply the full path of the reference and the distorted video.
